# 📊 Redis Streams Use Cases for Broking Houses & Securities

This repository contains implementation examples and technical documentation for using **Redis Streams** in real-time trading, market data processing, and user interaction scenarios common in broking houses and securities firms.

Redis Streams provide high-throughput, low-latency data pipelines and persistent message queues, enabling scalable, event-driven microservice architectures in the financial sector.

## 🚀 Use Cases Implemented

| # | Use Case Title |
|---|----------------|
| 1 | Order Book Event Streaming |
| 2 | Order Lifecycle Management |
| 3 | Trade Confirmation & Notification Streaming |
| 4 | Market Data Streaming & Replay |
| 5 | Trade Execution & Settlement Tracking |
| 6 | User Activity Streams for Real-Time Analytics |

---
## �️ Production Best Practices
- Use Redis Enterprise with replication, persistence (AOF), and high availability
- Monitor stream lag with XINFO and RedisInsight
- Use XGROUP, XPENDING, and XACK for reliable consumer processing
- Expire or archive old data using MAXLEN or XTRIM
- Secure Redis with TLS and access control (ACL)

## 📈 Business Benefits
- Ultra-low latency data ingestion and consumption
- Real-time trade confirmations and updates
- Replayable event logs for audit and recovery
- Improved user experience with faster UI updates
- High reliability and scalability for modern FinTech platforms

## 🧪 How to Run the Examples

### 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Redis Server (v5.0 or above)
- `redis-py` client library

```bash
pip install redis
```

```bash
import redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, decode_responses=True)

# Add an order event to stream
r.xadd("order_book_stream", {"order_id": "OID123", "symbol": "AAPL", "price": "202.5", "qty": "50"})

# Read the event
entries = r.xread({"order_book_stream": "0"}, count=5)
print(entries)
```
